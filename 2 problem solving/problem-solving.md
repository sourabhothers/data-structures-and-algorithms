## 1. Understand The Problem

1. Rephrase problem in own language
2. Inputs (considering **data types** for each input)

- from Parameters
- from database
- from third party API's

3. Outputs (expected **data types**)

- out can be
- saving in database
- sending through network

4. Can output be determined from Inputs ?

- eg. Sum function requires 2 arguments but Given only 1 . Then should we consider another as 0 or should throw error, etc.

5. Very important pieces of data that are part of problem

- eg. payment price during checkout

## 2. Explore Concrete Examples

1. Start with simple problem
2. Try complex one
3. examples with Empty inputs
4. Invalid inputs

## 3. Break it down (Write steps before starting writing code)

1. Write basic steps
2. Along with sub-steps & nested sub-steps

### 4. Solve / Simplify

1. Solve simple before complex
2. Simplify code

### 5. Look back & Refactor

- check output result
- output result differently
- is code understandable
- find common repeating code that can be use with another problem (like utilities / use cases )
- improve performance using Big O Notation (time & space complexity)
- refactor code
- check how other people solved problem
